Image resizing is a fundamental operation in computer vision, graphics processing, and web development. Traditional resizing methods such as scaling and cropping often lead to quality loss or unbalanced aspect ratios. To address this, more intelligent algorithms can be used to preserve important image content while adjusting dimensions.

This project explores three different algorithmic approaches to image resizing:

- Brute Force -> A straightforward method that evaluates all possible resizing paths, ensuring optimal results but at a high computational cost.
- Dynamic Programming –> A more efficient approach that breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems and reuses previous computations to reduce complexity.
- Greedy Algorithm –> A faster but heuristic-based method that makes locally optimal choices at each step, often leading to good (but not always optimal) results.
By comparing these techniques, this project aims to analyze their efficiency, accuracy, and suitability for different scenarios. The implementation includes performance benchmarking and visual comparisons of the resized images.
